#Project Title: Dynamic Greeting

Description:

This simple web project demonstrates basic JavaScript interactivity by allowing users to update a greeting message. When the user clicks the button, they are prompted to enter their name. The entered name is then converted to uppercase and replaces the default "world!" greeting, with the text color changing to red. This project is a beginner-friendly example of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle user input.
